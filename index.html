                    <p>Hi! My hometown is Dacula, Georgia, and I love teaching children how to code. During high school, I 
                        was a Code Ninjas Junior Instructor, and taught 20+ children ages
                    5-8 how to associate symbols with colors and categories through block code,
                    then colors and words through Scratch! In my free time, I enjoying working out,
                    engaging in various communities, watching shows, and strengthening my coding skills.</p>
                    <p1>HOVER ON ME!</p1>
